### Assignment 2: Generative vs. Discriminative Models

This assignment explores the differences between Naive Bayes (Generative Model) and Logistic Regression (Discriminative Model) using two datasets: Penguins and MNIST.

---

#### Part 1: Penguins Dataset
- **Objective**: Compare the performance of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression on a simple dataset.
- **Highlights**:
  - Accuracy comparison
  - AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) evaluation
  - Lift and Gain charts for model ranking
- **Dataset**: Penguins (Adelie and Gentoo species only).

---

#### Part 2: MNIST Dataset
- **Objective**: Extend the analysis to a more complex dataset (MNIST handwritten digits).
- **Highlights**:
  - Evaluate Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression on image data.
  - Compare performance differences between simple (Penguins) and complex (MNIST) datasets.
- **Dataset**: MNIST (Digits '0' and '1').
