# 📌 Assignment 3: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

---

## 📖 **1. Theory Questions**
Answer the following conceptual questions related to VAEs:

1️⃣ **Why is the KL Divergence term important in the VAE loss function?**  
2️⃣ **How does the reparameterization trick enable backpropagation through the stochastic layers of a VAE?**  
3️⃣ **Why does a VAE use a probabilistic latent space instead of a fixed latent space?**  
4️⃣ **What role does KL Divergence play in ensuring a smooth latent space?**

## 💻 **2. Coding Tasks**
Modify and expand the VAE architecture to improve its generative capabilities.

### 🔹 **Task 1: Convolutional VAE for CIFAR-10**

### 🔹 **Task 2: Latent Space Interpolation**

### 🔹 **Task 3: Training on a New Dataset**
