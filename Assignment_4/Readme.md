### **📌 Assignment 4: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

---

### **📖 1. Theory Questions**
Answer the following conceptual questions related to GANs:

1️⃣ **Explain the minimax loss function in GANs and how it ensures competitive training between the generator and discriminator.**  
2️⃣ **What is mode collapse, why can it occur during GAN training, and how can it be mitigated?**  
3️⃣ **Explain the role of the discriminator in adversarial training.**  
4️⃣ **How do metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) evaluate GAN performance?**

### **💻 2. Coding Tasks**
Modify and expand the GAN architecture to improve its generative capabilities.

#### 🔹 **Task 1: Modify the generator to include additional convolutional layers.**  

#### 🔹 **Task 2: Implement image saving after every 10 epochs**  
Use **spectral normalization** to stabilize GAN training and prevent mode collapse.

#### 🔹 **Task 3: Replace the MNIST dataset with CIFAR-10 and update the network for the new dimensions**
